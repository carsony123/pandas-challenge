From the data frames i created i can come to the conclusion that Charter schools preform better than public schools in all graded catagories. 
This conclusion allows you to focus on why thats the case. for example in the school size data frame we can clearly tell that school size has a direct correlation with the results. while the diffrence between small and medium isn't much the jump from medium to large shows that more students per school genrally leads to lower overrall grades and passing percentage.
We can gather that spending more money on each indvidual student doesn't lead to higher test scores.
Overall charter schools on average have less students attending but preform better overall. where the inverse is true for disctrict schools. 
Without more data you can't give more conclusions without bias. data like teaching styles or teaching schedules or start time and end time for schools more quantiative data to help with conclusions.
